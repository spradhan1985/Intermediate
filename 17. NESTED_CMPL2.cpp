What is the time complexity of the following code :
int a=0;
for(i=0;i<N;i++)
{
  for(j=N;j>i;j--)
  {
    a=a+i+j;
  }
}
T.C:O(N*N)
18. Time-Complexity-7
To measure Time complexity of an algorithm Big O notation is used which:
describes limiting behaviour of the function
characterises a function based on growth of function
upper bound on growth rate of the function
all of the mentioned

ans: all of the mentioned
