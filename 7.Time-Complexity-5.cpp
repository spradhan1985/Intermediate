What is the time complexity of following code:
 
int a = 0, i = N; 
while (i > 0) { 
    a += i; 
    i /= 2; 
}

T.C:O(log 2 base N)
 
8. Time-Complexity-6
  The complexity of Binary search algorithm is 
  O(log n)
9. Time-Complexity-8
If for an algorithm time complexity is given by O(1) then complexityof it is:
constant
10. If for an algorithm time complexity is given by O(log2n) then complexity will: 
logarthimic 
11. If for an algorithm time complexity is given by O(n) then complexityof it is:
linear
12. If for an algorithm time complexity is given by O((3/2)^n) then complexity will:
exponential
13.Time Complexity - 3.0
  What is the Time Complexity of the below Code?
  void solve()
{
  int i=1;
  while(i<n)
  {
   int x=i;
    while(x--)
    {
      //O(1) operation
    }
    i++;
  }
T.C: O(n^2)
